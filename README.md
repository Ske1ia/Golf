# Golf
The project inside Code utilises Java which i have learnt and applied to demonstrate my understanding with this language. This code can be placed inside an environment called Processing which visually outputs code.

The above is an example of the code output in Processing. 

Basic Instructions of game: 

1. The player is at the bottom shown in the black ball with a red inside. 

2. Every time the game is reset, the position of the goal is randomised to a certain extent which may increase the difficulty.

3.The aim is to shoot the player's ball into the Goal which is identified with the red flag. 

4. However the player cannot touch the two other balls which are constantly moving horizonatally. This was created using a for loop. 

5. The player can move the player's ball using the left and right arrow keys and press the space bar to launch the ball foward. 

6. If the player touches the bouncing balls, the game ends and returns the number of attempts to throw the ball. 

7. If the player wins, the game ends and returns the number of attempts to throw the ball.
